## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly is an "encounter"?
An encounter is recorded when Crosspaths detects another player through various means:
- **Grouping** with them (parties, raids, battlegrounds)
- **Proximity** detection (nameplates, mouseover)
- **Direct interaction** (targeting, focusing them)
- **Combat** participation (damage, healing, buffs between you)

To prevent spam, only **1 encounter per player per zone per session** is counted. A new session starts when you change zones or log in.

### Why don't I see high encounter counts?
The session-based system prevents encounter inflation. If you see the same player multiple times in the same zone during the same session, it only counts as 1 encounter. This gives more meaningful statistics about actual unique meetings rather than detection events.

### How accurate is the tracking?
Crosspaths only tracks what it can detect through the WoW API. Some limitations:
- Players must be within detection range (nameplates, interaction range)
- Some player information (class, level) may only be available when grouped
- Cross-realm players are tracked with their full "Name-Realm" identifier
