## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly is an "encounter"?
An encounter is recorded when Crosspaths detects another player through various means:
- **Grouping** with them (parties, raids, battlegrounds)
- **Proximity** detection (nameplates, mouseover)
- **Direct interaction** (targeting, focusing them)
- **Combat** participation (damage, healing, buffs between you)

To prevent spam, only **1 encounter per player per zone per session** is counted. A new session starts when you change zones or log in.

### Why don't I see high encounter counts?
The session-based system prevents encounter inflation. If you see the same player multiple times in the same zone during the same session, it only counts as 1 encounter. This gives more meaningful statistics about actual unique meetings rather than detection events.

### How accurate is the tracking?
Crosspaths only tracks what it can detect through the WoW API. Some limitations:
- Players must be within detection range (nameplates, interaction range)
- Some player information (class, level) may only be available when grouped
- Cross-realm players are tracked with their full "Name-Realm" identifier

### What are digest reports?
Digest reports are periodic summaries of your encounter activity:
- **Daily** - Shows encounters from the past 24 hours
- **Weekly** - Shows encounters from the past 7 days  
- **Monthly** - Shows encounters from the past 30 days

Access them via `/crosspaths digest [daily|weekly|monthly]` or the main interface.

### How do I manage my data?
Crosspaths provides several data management tools:
- **Remove specific players**: `/crosspaths remove <player-name>`
- **Clear all data**: `/crosspaths clear confirm` (requires confirmation)
- **Export data**: `/crosspaths export [json|csv]` for backup or analysis
- **Automatic pruning**: Configure in settings to automatically clean old data
